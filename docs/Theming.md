# Theme

Just for fun, I feel like it would be nice to pick a theme for Amber. Inspired by how Overmind is themed after the Zerg Overmind from Starcraft, and many of it's units, organizational units, base layouts, are inspired by names from the game, I would like to theme my bot in a similar way.

Currently, Amber is very clinically named: All of the Missions, Units, and Structures are named for exactly what they are. (Mining Mission, Distributor Operation, Worker, Hauler, etc). This is good in it's own way, as clear names should help to keep things focused on their task and clear in their purpose.

However, I think I would find it fun if I had a theme to go along.

### Witches!

The most obvious theme for me is of course Witches, Warlocks & Magic. Vaguely themed after Dungeon Keeper, with Demons.

Base (Colony) - Coven, Lair, Enclave
Spawn (Structure) - Summoning Portal
Spawn (Process) - Summoning
Container - Stash
Lab - Cauldron, Enchanter
Storage - Storeroom, Dungeon
Tower - Wizard's Tower, Focus
Power Spawn - Abysal Gate
Link - Translocator
Factor - Enchantment Table, Workbench (?)
Observer - Palant√≠r, Scryer
Nuker - Evoker


Miners - Imps
Haulers - Imps, Familars, (?)
Distirbutors - Summoners, Acolytes, Disciples
Lab (creep) - Alchemist, Potionmaster, Enchanter
Pioneers - Servants
Claimer - Claimer, Desecrator, Blighter
Reserver - Enchanter, Plaguespreader,
Scouts - Familiars, Sprite, Wisp

Melee - Brute, Troll, Minotars, Reapers, Demon
Ranged - Warlocks, Witch, Mage
Dismantler - Zombie, Umberhulk
Healer - Mystic, Witchdoctor, Plaguedoctor, Doctor, Witch


#### Undead

Another slight variation on the above it so explicitly theme it as Undead
