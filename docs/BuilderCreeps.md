# Builder Creeps

Just had a quick thought about how to manage "Build" missions.

It would be fine to have them have a special "tanker" body shape that combines Worker with Tanker

e.x. 6x max Work, 3x max Move, the rest Carry

They can follow the same protocol as Tanker creeps, where they need to request to be unloaded before they can move. This way the smaller Move parts only have to push the Work parts. This will simplify creep coordination because only 1 creep is needed to build (instead of a worker + tanker).

This will still make efficient use of the work/move parts, and give a buffer for Haulers to fill it.
