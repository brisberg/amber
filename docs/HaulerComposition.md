# Hauler Body Composition

Detailed analysis is available in my Hauler Sim Spreadsheet in Drive.

### Conclusions

#### Off Road
For Off-Road missions, it is best to use Balanced Haulers (1C1M) in all situations. They perform the best on cost, speed, and throughput.

However, it is worth noting that Heavy Haulers (2C1M) are still quite good offroad. They consistently perform only 15%-25% behind Balanced Haulers in offroad situations. It might be possible to always used Heavy Haulers regardless of available roads if raw Speed is not required.

Additionally Balanced Haulers cost ~35% more to build than Heavy Haulers.

#### On Road
For On-Road missions, it is generally best to use Heavy Haulers (2C1M) in nearly all situations. On Roads, they have 25%-30% higher throughput than their Balanced Hauler counterparts, and cost ~25% less to build.

Based on Spawn cost constraints, it is generally preferable to add pair of CARRY/MOVE parts if you cann't add a full 2C/1M to stay under the limit.

This will slightly increase throughput at a small increase in overall cost.

Example:
```
Spawn Limit: 550

6 Carry, 3 Move # Baseline Throughput
7 Carry, 4 Move # +16% Throughput, +22% Cost
8 Carry, 4 Move # Over Spawn Limit!
```
