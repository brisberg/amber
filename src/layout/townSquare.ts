/**
 * TownSquare is an abstraction around the core group of structures which make
 * up the heart of a base.
 *
 * The Square is a 6x7 layout, centered around the Storage in the center of
 * town. It includes all three spawns, and the Storage, Link, Terminal, Factory,
 * and Power Spawn centrally located so they can be exchanged by a single
 * transfer creep.
 *
 * This construct is used by the Spawn System for base layout, and by the
 * Distribution Mission for resource transfers.
